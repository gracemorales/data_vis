    <h2>Relationship Between Voting Frequency and Education/Income Level</h2>
    <iframe src="categories.html" width="1000" height="300" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

    <p> This parallel categories plot shows the relationship between voting frequency and education/income levels. The plot shows that people who
    rarely/never vote are more likely to have a high school or less level of education and be in the less than $40k income
    category. People who always or sporadically vote are more likely to be in the $75k and above income categories.

    <h2>Voter Turnout and Absentee Voting in Virginia from 2014 to 2022</h2>
    <iframe src="bubble.html" width="1000" height="620" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

    <p>This bubble chart shows how the percentage of absentee ballots and the percentage of voter turnout changed in Virginia
        overtime. It seems as though voter turnout increases in the years where there is a presidential election. Absentee voting
        increased in most Virginia counties in 2020, likely due to the coronavirus pandemic. In 2022, absentee voting overall was
        still higher than it had been in 2014, 2016, and 2018, even though it was two year after the start of the pandemic.

    <h2>Virginia Voter Turnout by Locality</h2>
    <iframe src="map.html" width="1000" height="600" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

    <p>This map shows the percent voter turnout by county Virginia. Northern Virginia and Eastern Virginia have 
        the highest voter turnout, while Southwest Virginia has the lowest voter turnout. Voter turnout does not go above 67
        percent or below 33 percent. Buchanan County had the lowest voter turnout.

    <p>To exceed expectations, I changed the font color and size, made the background a different color, and adjusted the
        margins and height. I used a font color and background color from a zen garden CSS template. I initially tried to
        create a separate file for the style, but I had a hard time getting it to work, so I decided to just put the styling 
        choices in the html file. I don't think my color and font choices particularly enhanced the figures, but I don't think
	they detract from them either. I chose colors that were not too harsh and that I enjoyed looking at. In the future, I want to experiment
	more with html because I really enjoyed the process of
        figuring out what types of designs I liked best.
